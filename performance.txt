MTrand.h generates pseudorandom integers uniformly distributed in 0..(2^32 - 1) starting from any odd seed in 0..(2^32 - 1)
rand.h passes ALL of the tests for random number generators and has a period of 2^144, is completely portable (gives bit identical results on all machines with at least 24-bit mantissas in the floating point representation): 
MTrand.h => 0-4294967296
rand.h => 0-22300745000000000000000000000000000000000000
